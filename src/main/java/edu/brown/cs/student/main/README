PROJECT: Project 1 Sprint

DESCRIPTION: API and KD-Tree

TEAM MEMBERS: Kat, Ben, Sheridan, Livia

Clothing, Review, and Users classes are the java objects in which the Json file is stored. 
They all implement the JSONObject interface so that Java registers that they are of the same type

Recieved some help from Helen Huang -- helped me update JsonHandler.
JsonHandler class reads the json files and convert them into the specific java object (so the rental clothing json file will be stored as a Clothing[] object, etc.)
